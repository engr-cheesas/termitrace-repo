# 🐜 Termite Detection and Extermination System using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project presents a **Termite Detection and Extermination System** designed for regular household wooden structures.  
The system integrates **acoustic sensing, thermal imaging, and machine learning-based image detection** to identify termite infestations, while extermination is performed through a **directed hot air mechanism**.  

Developed as a Computer Engineering thesis at Bulacan State University, the project followed the **Spiral Model (SDLC)** to ensure iterative design, risk analysis, and continuous improvements.

## 🐜 Problem Statement  
- Termite infestations cause **severe and often hidden structural damage**, especially in humid regions like the Philippines.  
- Existing solutions rely on **expensive equipment, manual inspections, or chemical pesticides**, which pose health and environmental risks.  
- No integrated system exists that provides **both detection and extermination** in a single device accessible to homeowners.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
Our system combines **non-invasive detection** and **eco-friendly extermination** using multiple technologies:  

- 🎥 **Image Detection (Machine Learning):** Identifies termite holes with **88% accuracy** and **96% precision**.  
- 🔊 **Acoustic Analysis:** Detects anomalies in wood via knocking frequency response.  
- 🌡️ **Thermal Imaging:** Detects temperature variations caused by termite activity.  
- 🔥 **Hot Air Extermination:** Achieved **100% extermination in softwood** and up to **82.5% efficiency overall**.  
- 🧠 **Rule-Based Wizard:** Triggers extermination **only if at least two detection methods confirm infestation**, minimizing false positives.
